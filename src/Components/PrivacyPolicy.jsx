        protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we are not

        The security of customers’ Personal Information is important to us. When
        customers enter sensitive information on our registration or other
        forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology
        (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
        Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once
        we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
        method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive
        to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Information, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security.
